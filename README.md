# M2 Merge Block Bot

![M2 Merge Block Game](https://github.com/Volcann/M2MasterBot/blob/92beb45387ec467a4a7d8915338a2f26dbbdc424/assets/image.png)

A comprehensive Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Heuristic-based AI framework for the **M2 Merge Block** game. This project serves as both a high-performance game bot and a research platform for observing RL dynamics, including real-time weight visualization and catastrophic failure cycles.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Multi-Strategy AI
- **Heuristic Engine**: A deterministic bot using hand-tuned weighted features to achieve consistent high scores.
- **Guided RL (Teacher-Student)**: An agent trained using heuristic guidance to accelerate convergence and stability.
- **Research RL (No-Teacher)**: A "pure" RL implementation using sparse rewards and epsilon-greedy exploration, designed to demonstrate the "Catastrophic Failure" cycle in deep reinforcement learning.

### 📊 Real-Time Visualization
- **Neural Weight Sparklines**: Live tracking of model weight volatility.
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time display of scores, rewards, and exploration (epsilon) rates.
- **Collapse Warnings**: Visual indicators for weight divergence and training instability.

## 🛠 AI Strategies

### 1. Heuristic Bot
The heuristic engine evaluates potential moves based on six key board features:

| Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Score** | Immediate points gained from the move. |
| **Empty Cells** | Maximizing available space on the 5x7 grid. |
| **Merge Count** | Number of successful merges triggered. |
| **Monotonicity** | Maintaining a logical gradient of values across rows/columns. |
| **Smoothness** | Minimizing value variance between adjacent blocks. |
| **Corner Bonus** | Keeping high-value tiles anchored in the corners. |

### 2. Reinforcement Learning
Supported RL paradigms include:
- **Q-Learning Implementation**: Linear function approximation using the same feature set as the heuristic bot.
- **Exploration Policy**: Epsilon-greedy decay starting from 100% exploration.
- **Sparse Rewards**: In Research Mode, the agent is only rewarded for high-value merges (e.g., ≥ 128), making the environment highly challenging.

## 🎮 Execution Commands

### Play the Game
Test your skills against the AI or play manually:
```bash
python3 src/run_bot.py      # Run the Heuristic Bot
python3 src/rl_run_bot.py   # Run the RL Bot
python3 src/play.py         # Play Manually (Controls: Mouse or 0-4)
```

### RL Training & Research
Observe the agent's learning process in real-time:

#### Guided Training (Stable)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m training.rl.train_with_teacher
```

#### No-Teacher Training (Visualize Failure Cycle)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m training.rl.train_standard --episodes 200 --lr 0.1
```
